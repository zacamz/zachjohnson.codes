<p class=MsoNormal>I am Excited. Excited to start. I don’t know how long the
momentum will last but I think I should give this a go. What is this? Creating
this website. Expressing myself through code. Will it amount to much? Probably not.
But what do I have to lose? Mostly Motivation. I guess. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want so many things for this site. I don’t want it to be a
WordPress site. I don’t want it to be easy or beautiful. I want it to be an
expression of who I am. Why? Because this whole thing is futile anyway. I am
unknown. Just a guy with a laptop sitting in the middle of a swamp. I am not
Mark Zuckerburg or Jeff Bezos. I have barely maintained 300 followers on Instagram
and spend most of my money on Amazon. What I have thought is the opportunity to
make something. Anything. To give it life and then let it sit dormant like the
millions of other blogs out there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You know what really inspired me to write this?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I work at Amazon in a Fulfillment Center; I got certified in
a bootcamp in Front End Development through that Job. What am I doing with that
Certificate? Becoming a Data analyst for the Learning Department at that site.
This job is to literally just be a jack of all trades coding and hacking
together quick solutions for the most mundane of problems. BUT I LOVE IT!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I spend hours upon hours every week trudging through half-baked
internal wiki pages and getting lost in ultra technical documents that I have
no business reading. Just looking for anything that can help me with the basic
needs of my job, and I found this guy on the internal stack overflow page
answering so many of my questions that were providentially asked by the other people
stumbling through the dark just like me. He was wearing a Bow Tie and instead
of just supplying code, this man was diving in and creating Libraries for the superfluous
and creating Modules for the Obscure and pushing for innovations in the ways
that are overlooked. I appreciated it so much. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had to look this guy up. He had left. I tried to add him
on LinkedIn, nothing. But I did see he had a blog. What was awesome though was
he had maintained it for 7 years!! I was astonished. What perseverance! I read
some of his work and it was full of passion projects and advice to people like
me and I decided right there. I was going to document my Journey too. WHY NOT. If
I could be so inspired by someone relatively unknown then there was a slight
chance that I could do the same for someone else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So Here it goes. I’m off. <br>
<br>
Also here is a link to his Blog. </p>
