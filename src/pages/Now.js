                I am Farming Full Time:
                    I am working on <a href="https://www.bountifulblessingsfarm.com">Bountiful Blessings Farm</a> in Williamsport TN, It is a 7 Acre Market Garden and it is really been an awesome experience. I love the variety of things to do and the slower pace. The fact that I am making a real impact in indivdual lives by providing good clean food is awesome. The Spirtual fufillment here is so awesome too! Just all around I am really happy that I left working out in a factory to working out in Nature.

                    in the last few months I have really been focusing on my relationship with God. I have been reading my Bible more and praying more. I have also been going to church more regularly. I feel like I am really starting to understand what it means to be a Christian and I am excited to see where this journey takes me. I have done this by joinging in a program called
