                I am Farming Full Time:
                    I am working on <a href="https://www.bountifulblessingsfarm.com">Bountiful Blessings Farm</a> in Williamsport TN, It is a 7 Acre Market Garden and it is really been an awesome experience. I love the variety of things to do and the slower pace. The fact that I am making a real impact in indivdual lives by providing good clean food is awesome. The Spirtual fufillment here is so awesome too! Just all around I am really happy that I left working out in a factory to working out in Nature.
